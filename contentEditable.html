<span>I am working on <span>a systems <span>integration</span> project</span> that has gotten itself into what I call a SpaghettiArchitecture? - a bunch of (generally small) programs that connect one database to another, or one app to another, and so on. This has been a result of DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork. "Well, we need to get this data over there." "Oh, just write a little batch transfer program." The result rapidly becomes an unmaintainable mess - everything depends on everything else, the business logic is scattered, and there's not even a single codebase to RefactorMercilessly.</span>

So perhaps we can say that DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork is a reasonable approach within a single program or codebase (provided, of course, that we RefactorMercilessly and UnitTest to keep it from becoming FlimsyAndBarelyFunctional). But on an architectural level, it is absolutely necessary to do a BigDesignUpFront (or at least a SmallDesignUpFront?) - put the right architectural components in place, plan for future expansion, decide how we're going to let our different apps and programs be loosely coupled, and so on. -- RobertEikel

This doesn't sound like DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork at all to me. It sounds a lot more like DoTheQuickestThingThatMightWorkForAWhile. Programs were simply plugged in without any particular thought to the overall picture. I've never read or heard of anything in XP that says this is a good idea.
